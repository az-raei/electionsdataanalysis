        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vote Share vs Seat Loss:</strong> Despite a positive vote share percentage change, BJP witnessed a net loss in seats compared to 2019, indicating a disconnect between vote consolidation and seat conversion.</li>
            <li><strong>Uttar Pradesh Setback:</strong> One of the most significant blows to BJP was its loss in Uttar Pradesh, which has over 80 seats, heavily impacting its overall tally.</li>
            <li><strong>Southern Expansion:</strong> The opposition, particularly Congress and regional allies, made notable gains in South India, specifically in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, regions where BJP had struggled to establish a stronghold.</li>
            <li><strong>Emerging Role of Regional Parties:</strong> Several regional parties, such as TMC in West Bengal and DMK in Tamil Nadu, played decisive roles in shifting power balances, highlighting the growing influence of state-level politics in national elections.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 2024 election results highlight the evolving political landscape in India. While leading parties maintained strong voter bases, strategic alliances significantly impacted the final seat count. This underscores the importance of coalition politics in shaping governance.</p>
        <p>These findings emphasize the need for deeper research into micro-level voter behavior, regional political strategies, and the role of digital influence in modern elections.</p>
